Veloce is not an MVC framework, but still handle all of your php files, and protect all your web application !

To get started, launch install.php and follow the inscrutionsn then put ALL your php files in the App folder.
You can now use the framework without addind any line of code ! For exemple, lets say you want to get an post in a database where the id is 5 in the table posts, just type $bdd->setActiveTable("posts"); and $bdd->get("'id' = 5");

Your done !
