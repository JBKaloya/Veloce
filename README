A simple php framework.

First, but it in your web directory, then put yours file in the same folder where Veloce' lib and config dir are.
Then, edit config.php to configure.

For using it, simple add at the very top of your code :
require_once("lib/veloce.inc.php");

Then, if you want to, for exemple, set a cookie, just type $cookie->set("Name", "Value");
